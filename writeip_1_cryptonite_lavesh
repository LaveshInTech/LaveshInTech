(HELLO)
 In the first task we were given a command to just copy paste into the terminal
In the second task we were told about the difference between a command and arguments
basically the first keyword is the command and all the other words following it are the arguments.
(PONDERING PATHS)
we just had to do ‘/pwn’ and got the flag
we had the executable file inside another directory so we again had a basic comman ‘/challenge/run’ and got the flag
we put  cd /challenge
we put ./run
Here we learned the difference between relative and absolute paths
(comprehending commands)
cat is most often used for reading out files
Sometimes, the files that we might cat out are too big we use the grep command to search for the contents we need.
For listing the files win all the directories provided yo it as arguments we use ls command at linux.
By using the Touch command we can make a new blank file.
by using rm command we can remove the files also.
by using mkdir command we can make a new directory also.
we can use ln command to link the file and also the original file path comes before the link path in the command
(digesting documentation)
we can do man command to get a list of possible arguments with their description
some programs don't have a man page, so we can use help command to get a list of possible arguments with their description.
(file globbing)
we can use* in any argument then it  replace that argument with any files that match the pattern
‘?’ is similar to * but it only matches that one character in that specified place
[] is like ? That matches a possible subsets of potential characters within the set
PIPPING
Piping in Linux is a way to connect the output of one command directly into the input of another command.
‘>’ can be used to redirect the stdout to other files
‘>>’ can be used to append the stdout to other files
